# Armut-Association-Rule-Based-Recommender-System
 Armut, Turkey's premier online platform, connects service providers with people looking for services. It makes obtaining services such as cleaning, repairs, and transportation simple and convenient, via a few clicks on a computer or mobile device. The plan is to develop a system for recommending products using Association Rule Learning, by analyzing data on users who have received services, and the types and services they received.
